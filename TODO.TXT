- sort by heuristic
- all optimal moves
- all winning moves
- enable players to play against CPU
- implement undo
- multiple moves by player in a row analyzed correctly (implemented, check accuracy)
- endless loops -> draw: check if current state already on the stack (implemented, check accuracy)
- template Value, HValue for stuff other than int?
- allow display without evaluation


done:

- alpha-beta bug: B1 A1 C1 A3 A2 optmove (B2)
